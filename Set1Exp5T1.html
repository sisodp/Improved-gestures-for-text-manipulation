<h3>Amelia Earhart: Expedition returns without evidence</h3>
The International Group for Historic Aircraft Recovery (Tighar) believes Earhart and her navigator crashed on a Pacific island and died soon after.

The $2.2m (£1.4m) expedition was searching for evidence of the wreckage in the waters around Nikumaroro.

Amelia Earhart was the first woman to fly solo across the Atlantic, in 1932.

"This is just sort of the way things are in this world," Tighar president Pat Thrasher said.

"It's not like an Indiana Jones flick where you go through a door and there it is. It's not like that - it's never like that."

Next year Tighar is planning a return voyage to the island, where they believe Earhart may have survived for a short time.

'Nightmare terrain'
The research team collected video and sonar data, and is expected to begin analysing it on the return journey to Hawaii, Ms Thrasher said.

Amelia Earhart

Born in Kansas in 1897
First woman to fly solo across the Atlantic Ocean
Helped form the Ninety-Nines, a professional aviation group for women, and became their first president
Held multiple speed records
Updates from her husband, Ric Gillespie, who founded Tighar, suggested the search was cut short to five days from 10 because of "nightmare terrain", and accidents with equipment.

On 2 July 1937, Amelia Earhart and and her navigator Fred Noonan took off from Papua New Guinea in their Electra 10E aircraft, en route to Howland Island.

Many experts think a navigational error caused the pair to run out of fuel over the sea. They were never seen again.

They were three-quarters of the way through an unprecedented circumnavigation of the globe around the equator.

On 3 July, the USS Colorado departed from Hawaii in search of Earhart and Noonan.

The research team set sail 75 years to the day after search teams went looking for the pair.

Tighar's expedition had the approval of the US state department and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton.


Prime Minister Stephen Harper will hold a “full and frank” discussion Tuesday about gun violence with Toronto Mayor Rob Ford in the wake of a rash of deadly  shootings, but he will not endorse the mayor’s idea to outright ban gun criminals from Canada’s largest city.

And while Ford has complained about the failure of “hug a thug” programs — he even voted against accepting $350,000 in federal funding for a gang intervention project — a spokesman for Harper said the prime minister would nonetheless outline efforts his government has already taken.

That includes a “significant investment” in the youth gang prevention fund, Andrew MacDougall noted.

“You do have to provide programs to keep kids away from crime,” he said. “There are multiple fronts to take action on.”
The comments suggest the two staunch Conservatives may be at odds in their approach to gun crime, a problem that reached new heights in Toronto last week when shots rang out at a community barbecue, leaving two people dead and 23 wounded in the city’s east end.

“This is really a chance for the prime minister to listen to the mayor’s concerns. Obviously the city has been through a traumatic event. We think gun crime and gang crime is serious, that’s why we passed bills to stiffen sentences for each of those,” MacDougall said.

“We’re happy to walk the mayor through that, go over what we’ve done and listen to any ideas he has.”

While the government will consider further sentencing and legal options, MacDougall said a law barring gun criminals from Toronto isn’t something the federal government has proposed or would endorse.

He suggested that even the mayor has “backpedalled” from the idea, which he first proposed last week while musing about the possibilities under Canadian immigration law.

Immigration Minister Jason Kenney has also publicly pooh-poohed the plan, noting the government can’t tell people where they can and can’t live. He has instead trumpeted proposed legislation that would speed up the process for deporting foreign criminals.

Ford indicated he was still seeking a sit-down with Harper to discuss it and got his wish Monday when the Prime Minister’s Office confirmed Harper would meet with him Tuesday afternoon in Toronto.

<h3>2 possible tornadoes probed in eastern Ontario</h3>

Environment Canada investigators are working to verify two unconfirmed tornado sightings near Golden Lake and Lanark County during powerful thunderstorms that swept through eastern Ontario on Monday.

"We had a line of thunderstorms go through a fair portion of eastern Ontario, starting up in North Bay in the morning, and then crossing through Algonquin Park and Lanark County and all the way down to Ottawa. And actually the storm eventually reached Montreal," said meteorologist Ria Alsen.

"The storms were <font color="red"> 2) </font>pretty intense and so far, we've had two <font color="red"> 2) </font>unconfirmed reports of tornadoes — one near Golden Lake, in Eganville, and another in Lanark County."

Both sightings were reported by Ontario Provincial Police, Alsen said.

Damage survey teams dispatched
Damage survey teams have been dispatched to determine whether tornadoes actually touched down. They'll look for evidence of wind rotation, such as trees snapped off from the top and other sporadic damage. Trees that have fallen in the same direction and more widespread building damage tend to indicate straight heavy winds, Alsen said.

Meanwhile, thousands of Hydro One customers in eastern Ontario are still without power this morning. The affected outage area stretches from west of Barry's Bay to Vankleek Hill.

The biggest outages in eastern Ontario, in an area encompassing Renfrew and Calabogie, saw power cut to about 5,600 homes.

At one point Monday, Hydro Ottawa reported 8,600 customers had lost power in communities including Gloucester, Goulbourn, Kanata and Nepean after power lines were brought down. As of 8 p.m. ET, that number was reduced to 2,500.

Hundreds of customers in Rideau-Goulbourn were still without power early this morning, but some of the outages were fixed before 8 a.m.

About 300 customers remained without power as of 8:30 a.m. ET, half of them in the rural area around Munster. Hydro Ottawa spokeswoman Rebecca Turcotte said the majority of the remaining outages are in small, isolated pockets. She said all power should be restored later today.

Ottawa's airport, which had cancelled or delayed arriving and departing flights during the storm, reopened just after 7 p.m. ET Monday.
